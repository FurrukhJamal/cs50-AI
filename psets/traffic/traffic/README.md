I have noticed that increasing the number of hidden layers is not having much effect on the accuracy as compared to the number of units in a single hidden layer. With about 64 convolution filters with size 3, 3 and 650 units for the hidden layer with a dropout of 0.4 I was able to achieve 0.9474 accuracy. With decreasing the number of filters by 15 and increasing the units for hidden layer by 100, the acciracy went to 0.9395. At number of filters 138 and hidden layer's number of units at 550 i was getting an accuracy of 0.9431. I noticed that changing the number of units in the hidden layers and changing the number of filters was not changing the accuracy much after some point and it stayed bw 0.93 to 0.94. So i changed the strategy and removed the hidden layers and re convolated the image i got from the first convolation and max pooling, to my surprise i got a accuracy of 0.9676 and the process ran much faster, so i think this is the best model one can make from the given data
